## [v1.0.0] – 2020-04-09
**Initial release (data model)**

The first version of the WRITE ontology was created by the former collaborator, as a structured RDF-based data model.  
It included preliminary concepts and properties to capture key entities in the domain, with minimum descriptions and without domain / range declarations.  
Turtle files were provided for basic semantic interoperability.
