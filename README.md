### WRITE ontology

This ontology is designed to represent the intangible cultural heritage of Chinese calligraphy as it appears in contemporary artworks, alongside the broader tangible cultural heritage of contemporary arts. The WRITE ontology provides a structured way to describe artworks, their contextual elements, and the calligraphy integrated within them. Additionally, it facilitates the identification of similarities and differences between contemporary and traditional calligraphy, enabling a deeper understanding of their evolution and artistic connections.

It is developed and maintained within the **WenDAng - WRITE Digital Archive project**.

📅 **Latest version:** v2.0.0 (2025-02-05)
